So my concern has to do with the fact that AI is metastasizing this surveillance business model  in that way we can see ai as a product of concentrated surveillance power not as an actual fundamentally new set of technologies 

it was a way to make more use of the data and compute that were already at the heart of the market powers of these companies 

it was not just one more point along a positivist arc of scientific pogress

The business model that emerges like a mushroom from Internet was the surveillance advertising business model = "publiité de surveillance"

In 2015, generative AI is being packaged as the zeitgeist, another kind of crucial watershed.
En 2015, l'IA générative est présentée comme l'esprit du temps, une autre forme de tournant crucial.

If you define democraty as a representative government where we get to vote  for Google or Amazon or Facebook, then you can democratize AI. 

How do you democratize a technology that itself in the form we are seing it now is a product of concentrated power. How do you democratize concentrated power ?
